# CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION
Hello everyone! In this notebook I have worked on Vehicle dataset from cardekho Dataset . This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com.I have used diffrent regression model to finding best prediction.


The datasets consist of several independent variables include:

1.Car_Name
2.Year
3.Selling_Price
4.Present_Price
5.Kms_Driven
6.Fuel_Type
7.Seller_Type
8.Transmission
9.Owner


I have applied couple of regression models on dataset. From the final dataframe, it gives opinion about the score of models and also the plots help us to understand which models is more succesful.
